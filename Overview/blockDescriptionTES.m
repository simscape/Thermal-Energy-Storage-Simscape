%% Description 
% The Sand Battery block models a thermal energy storage by using sand as the energy storage medium. 
% The block stores the energy in form of sensible heat of the sand. 
% The block models a network of electrical heating coil, hot sand mass, cold sand mass, and moist air pipe.
% The subcomponents connect through each other using Conductive Heat
% Transfer blocks. The electrical heater and the hot sand mass connect to
% each other using a Radiative Heat Transfer block because, at high
% electrical heater temperatures, the radiation heat transfer is the dominant mode of heat transfer between the heater and the sand.
%% 
% This figure shows the model of a single unit cell of the sand battery.
% To calculate the sand battery energy storage, the block multiplies the
% thermal energy stored in a single cell by total number of cells. To
% calculate the total number of celles, the block multiplies the values of 
% the |Number of coil rows| and |Number of coils in each row| parameters. The block
% calculates all the electrical and heat transfer resistances by assuming
% parallel-connected cells. To ensure the accuracy of the energy
% calculation, the Biot number criterion internally constraints the mass of
% the sand associated with the heating coil or moist air pipe.
