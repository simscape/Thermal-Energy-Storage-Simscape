%% Residential Building Heating with TES and PV 


% Copyright 2023 - 2024 The MathWorks, Inc.

%% Model Overview
% The residential heating model comprises a rooftop photovoltaic (PV) panel 
% for charging the thermal battery, a thermal energy storage for 
% storing renewable energy, a hot water tank for storing hot water, a heat 
% exchanger (HEX) for heating the water, a pump for supplying hot 
% water to the house, and an air blower for taking out the stored heat from the thermal battery.
%% 
% To increase the efficiency of the system PV panels, the model recovers the heat by circulating the water through 
% the channels below the PV panels. The Control subsystem controls the water pump and air blower pressure to 
% achieve the set temperature of the hot water tank. The subsystem also operates the flow control valve. 
% The flow control valve allows the water to flow towards the PV panels that are hotter than the tank temperature.

%% Model Subsystems
%% 
% *Photovoltaic Panel Subsystem*
%
% The Photovoltaic panel subsystem models the solar battery that converts the
% sunlight into electricity. The subsystem uses a Solar Cell block that allows you to choose a pre-parameterized PV component.
%
% *MPPT Converter Subsystem*
% 
% The PV panel produces a power as a function of the load resistance that connects to the panel. 
% To maximize the power that the PV panels produce when they connect to the heating coil network of a given resistance, you require an MPPT converter.
% This picture shows equivalent circuit of MPPT.

%
% The MPPT Converter subsystem receives two inputs:
%% 
% * The net heating coil resistance that connects to the PV panel $R_L$
% * The Voltage $V_m$ at which the PV panel produces the maximum power.
%% 
% PV panel suppliers provide the value of $V_m$ in the product datasheet.
% To maximize the PV power, the MPPT sets the voltage across the panel to
% $V_m$.
% If the current from the PV panel is $I_m$, then the power that the PV
% panel produces is equal to $V_m*I_m$.
%
% The heater coil dissipates a power equal to $V_L^2/R_L$.
%
% To calculate the MPPT terminal voltage, the MPPT Converter subsystem equates the
% two powers and solve for $V_L$:
%
% $V_L \ =\ \sqrt{V_m \times I_m \times R_L }$.
% 
% 
% *Residential Unit Subsystem*
%
% The Residential Unit subsystem comprises an electrical resistor to model the household power consumption and a thermal network to model the
% temperature variation of the rooms. Hot water radiators heat the rooms when the outside atmosphere temperature drops below the room set point temperature. The roof of the rooms 
% thermally connects to the PV panel. The floor of the rooms
% thermally connects to the TES by using a Conductive Heat Transfer block.   
%
% *Thermal Energy Storage Subsystem*
%
% To model the sand battery, the Thermal energy storage subsystem uses a
% Sand TES custom block.
