%% Overview
% Climate change and its effects on the day-to-day life are an upward trend. 
% To offset the ill effects of climate change, all major world economies adapted aggressive plans to cut the greenhouse emissions.
% Renewable energy sources are a promising solution to meet 
% the increasing energy demands and reduce the carbon footprint.
% To bridge the gap between the demand and the generation of the renewable power, you must design an effective energy storage system.    
%% 
% The market offers different energy storage technologies. 
% While you cannot standardize the storing of electrical power for all applications, you can possibly use the TES to replace 
% the electrical heating and burning of fossil fuels for heating buildings.
% Before installing a TES hardware, you must also perform a basic analysis of return on capital investment.
